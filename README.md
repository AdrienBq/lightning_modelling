## Abstract

Most lightning parameterization schemes rely on local approaches where the predictors are the atmospheric variables in the same grid cell as the output. To validate the hypothesis that large-scale thunderstorm clusters – such as mesoscale convective systems – are driven by broad spatial predictor patterns, we model lightning occurrence using architectures capable of processing surrounding grid-cell data rather than relying solely on local point-based inputs. This study develops a deep convolutional neural network (U-Net) to model lightning occurrence across Europe using ERA5 reanalysis data. The model is trained on 13 years of data and evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation strategy. We compare the performance of the U-Net to several local machine learning models of increasing complexity, including logistic regression, generalized additive model, extreme gradient boosting, and multi-layer perceptron. We find that the U-Net outperforms all single grid cell models in overall performance and on the most extreme events. Through a feature importance study, we find that the most important predictors depend on the model type. Finally we show with a spatial sensitivity study that the U-Net captures mesoscale patterns driving lightning occurrence.

## Installation

### Python version

This project targets **Python 3.10** (pinned in `.python-version`); `pyproject.toml`
declares `requires-python = ">=3.10"`, so newer versions work for the portable install.
`uv` reads the pin automatically and will fetch 3.10 if you don't have it. For the
`pip install -r requirements.txt` path, use 3.10 specifically — that freeze was
captured on 3.10 and its pinned wheels are not all available on newer versions.

### uv build (fastest)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AdrienBq/lightning_modelling.git
cd lightning_modelling
uv sync
```

### pip build

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AdrienBq/lightning_modelling.git
cd lightning_modelling

# Portable install (uses the loose version ranges in pyproject.toml; CPU-friendly)
pip install .

# OR, to reproduce the authors' exact environment (a fully pinned freeze that
# includes GPU/CUDA wheels — heavier, and intended for a CUDA machine):
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** `pip install .` / `uv sync` and `requirements.txt` are **not** equivalent.
> The first resolves the loose ranges from `pyproject.toml` and works on CPU-only
> machines; `requirements.txt` is a full pinned freeze of the authors' GPU environment.
> The demo notebooks run on CPU, so the portable install is recommended for most users.
